OpenDIF (Open Data Interchange Framework) is the core open-source software for building a powerful data exchange. This framework acts as an intelligent intermediary, replacing a complex maze of siloed data sources with a single, unified point of access. For any organization—be it a large company, university, or government agency—this hub provides a streamlined way to request, combine, and receive aggregated data, simplifying even the most complex data requests.

Look at the [GitHub project](https://github.com/OpenDIF) for more information.
