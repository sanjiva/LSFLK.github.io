Dalesa is a Free and Open Source Peer-to-Peer web caching software licensed under GPL-2 that will improve web performance in your local area network. Dalesa brings cooperative web caching based on peer-to-peer computing to your desktop. Nodes participating in the network will expose their web caches to the entire system through peer-to-peer web object (document) lookup algorithms.

This project focuses on using various group communication technologies such as distributed hash tables and IP multicasting to implement robust document lookup techniques. The system provides a proxy interface and an API for browsers and other potential user agents. User agents such as web browsers can embed the peer-to-peer lookup algorithm by using the API. However, when changes to the code of the user agent is not allowed or inconvenient the http proxy can be used.
