Sahana Agasti is a Free and Open Source Disaster Management system that was developed in the wake of the Asian Tsunami of December 2004. It is a web based collaboration tool that addresses the common coordination problems during a disaster including locating missing people, managing aid, managing volunteers, and tracking camps effectively between Government groups, the civil society (NGOs) and the victims themselves.

Sahana was first developed by the Lanka Software Foundation in collaboration with the global disaster management community and was later handed over to the <a href="https://sahanafoundation.org">Sahana Software Foundation</a> (SSF). The SSF went on to create Sahana EDEN, a Python-based version of the original Sahana PHP project. Sahana EDEN has become the most popular open source information management for disaster management and humanitarian aid agencies.

The Mission of the Sahana Software Foundation is to help alleviate human suffering by giving emergency managers, disaster response professionals and communities access to the information that they require to be better prepared for and respond more quickly to disasters through the development and promotion of free and open source software and open standards.
