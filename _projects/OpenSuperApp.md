OpenSuperApp is an open-source Super App Framework built on micro-app architecture, enabling developers to integrate, orchestrate, and manage multiple web apps inside a unified container. It empowers organizations to create modular, scalable, and secure app ecosystems — without rebuilding authentication, communication, and lifecycle management for each individual app.

Initially developed by <a href="https://wso2.com">WSO2</a> for their internal employee app, it is now a project being further developed by LSF as a platform for public sector adoption.
