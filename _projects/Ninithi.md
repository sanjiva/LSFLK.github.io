Ninithi is a free and opensource software developed to visualize and analyze the carbon allotropes used in nanotechnology. Ninithi can be used to visualize Carbon nanotubes, Graphene/ nanoribbons and Fullerene and to plot the band structures of Graphene and Carbon nanotubes. The software is licensed under the GNU Public Licence version 3.

The objective is to develop an open source modelling and simulation software that helps nano scientists, students and lecturers with their research.
