<b>NOTE: This is a past project of LSF that was active from {{ page.start_date }} to {{ page.end_date }}.</b>

The goal of this project was to build a Student Information System (SIS) with data on over 4.3 million students and over 10,000 schools. Working in collaboration with the Data Management Branch of the Ministry of Education (MoE), the objective of the project was to improve the planning, quality, delivery and outcomes of education across the country.

The SIS platform was built using UNICEF's <a href="https://www.openemis.org/">OpenEMIS</a> solution. While the initial deployment was somewhat successful and gathered data from close to three million students, with change of leadership and changing priorities of the Ministry of Education, this effort was halted.
