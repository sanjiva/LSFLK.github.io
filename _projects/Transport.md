<b>NOTE: This is a past project of LSF that was active from {{ page.start_date }} to {{ page.end_date }}.</b>

The National Passenger Service Platform (NPSP) project involved the operation of a network of multimodal transport hubs around the Greater Colombo region (3K Project) as well as the provision of public with bus/ train-level connections, schedules, location and time of arrival/ departure.

LSF engaged to complete the initial high level design of the platform and helped develop the timetable dashboards used in the terminals.
