Project Silver is a plan to build a new kind of email and communication system that can work at a government scale. The goal is to make email faster, smarter, and easier to manage while keeping it secure and reliable. Silver will be built in two main stages — Version 1.0 and Version 2.0.

Version 1.0 will be a normal email system using proven and stable technology. It will include features like sending and receiving emails, spam filtering, antivirus protection, and secure delivery. This version will focus on creating a strong and dependable base that follows standard email protocols.

Version 2.0 will take things further by introducing new ways to handle communication. It will include Raven, Silver’s own Mail Delivery Agent, which will manage email delivery, work as an LMTP server, and support the JMAP protocol. This version will also bring in features such as group emails, role-based mail addresses, and support for domain and subdomain management, making it ideal for large organizations.

Instead of saving emails as files, Silver will use a database to store and manage them. This will make it faster to find emails, easier to back up data, and better for scaling as the system grows. Attachments and large files will be stored separately in object storage to save space and improve performance.

Silver will also include a new Mail Client built for both mobile and desktop devices. This client will use JMAP as the main protocol to retrieve and sync emails in a modern and efficient way. With these improvements, Project Silver aims not just to rebuild email, but to reimagine communication — making it more efficient, organized, and ready for the future.
