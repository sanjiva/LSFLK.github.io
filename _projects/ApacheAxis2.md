SOAP is an industry-standard XML-based communication Protocol for communicating between applications. The Apache Axis Java project developed the most widely recognized and used, open source Java SOAP implementation. A new architecture for Axis2 was introduced during the August 2004 Summit in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The new architecture on which Axis2 is based on, is more flexible, efficient and configurable in comparison to Axis1.x architecture.

Apache Axis2 not only supports SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2, but it has also integrated support for the widely popular REST style of Web services. The same business logic implementation can offer both a WS-* style interface as well as a REST/POX style interface simultaneously.

Apache Axis2 is more efficient, more modular and more XML-oriented than the older version. It is carefully designed to support the easy addition of plug-in "modules" that extend their functionality for features such as security and reliability.
