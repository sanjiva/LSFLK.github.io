SOAP is an industry-standard XML-based communication Protocol for communicating between applications. LSF in its pioneering project, initiated an effort to develop a C++ SOAP implementation for Apache. Axis C/C++ (Axis CPP) is a non-Java implementation of Axis. At its core Axis CPP has a C++ runtime engine.

The tooling provided allows you to create C++ client-side stubs and server-side skeletons. The server skeletons can be deployed to either a full Apache web server using the supplied apache module or a "simple_axis_server" – which is a simple HTTP listener (designed to help you test your services).
